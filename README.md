# Collection of data in respect of dams in distress conditions

# Team Name - IT Innovators COEP
# Table Number - 17

There are about five thousand large dams in our country. Many dams are in distress conditions. However, the availability of data in respect of the extent of distress is very scanty.

A mobile based platform could be developed to provide a facility to authorities/common people for entry of some important parameters in respect of these dams which will be helpful in short listing dams needing immediate attention. Same platform can be extended to enter information about any government owned facilityâ€™s condition in future.

A set of desired parameters will need to be decided as a prerequisite.
Also, a set of Prerequisites, Set of desired parameters, Set of facilities

## Roles in system :
Data Providers : Common Users, Auditors, Ministry/State government officials (Authorities).
Consumers : Water Management Ministry, Dam maintaining state boards etc.

## Group Members :

Back-end Team (Flask REST API and Database) : 
                Yogiraj Kulkarni
				& Aditya Karamchandani

Front-end Team (Web-UI) : Amit Kamthe
						  & Ajinkya Chavan

Android App Team : Tushar Agey
				   & Vaidehi Deshpande

## Solution :
Will help solve the problem of availability of data on common parameters,
Identification of facilities which need attention,
Can also help in identifying future maintenance works based on available data

## Desired Outcome :
1. A webpage/mobile app to accept data for given set of parameters against a selected facility
2. Send notifications to state as well as central bodies for the entered data
3. Generate reports based on priority, state, facility etc.

## Significant features :
1. Location based data validation
2. Notifications to Authorities
2. Authority to the Authorities
3. SMS Alerts for dams that require immediate attention
4. Centralized system
5. Supports multiple languages
6. Facility to capture both photos and videos of dams

## Requirements :

2. Flask
3. MySQL Database
4. Android 5.0 or higher (For the Android Client)
5. Python MySQL-Connector

## How to Set up :
